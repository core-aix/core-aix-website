CORE-AIx is a mission-driven AI lab focused on one question: **how do we make next-generation AI genuinely collaborative, optimized, reliable, and efficient?**

We are based in the [Department of Computer Science](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk) at the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk) in the UK.

Beyond mission, our work is organized around three practical dimensions: research depth, systems realism, and open communication.

We study core AI questions at the intersection of intelligence, optimization, and distributed systems. We test ideas under real-world constraints. We also share progress through concise blogs and news updates.

This site shares our direction, people, milestones, and areas of interest as the lab grows.
