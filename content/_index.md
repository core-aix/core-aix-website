CORE-AIx is a mission-driven AI lab focused on one question: **how do we make next-generation AI genuinely collaborative, optimized, reliable, and efficient?**

We are based in the [Department of Computer Science](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk) at the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk) in the UK.

Beyond mission, our work is organized around three practical dimensions: research depth, systems realism, and open communication.

We study core AI questions at the intersection of intelligence, optimization, and distributed systems. We test ideas under real-world constraints. We also share progress through concise blogs and news updates.

This website is also an experiment where much of the contents, such as research summaries, news, and blogs, as well as the code for the website itself, are produced by AI, with only light human-editing. However, rest assured that the research outputs (e.g., papers) from our lab are mostly written and fully verified by humans 😊
