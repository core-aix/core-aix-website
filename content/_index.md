CORE-AIx is a mission-driven AI lab focused on one question: **how do we make next-generation AI genuinely collaborative, optimized, reliable, and efficient?**

Beyond mission, our work is organized around three practical dimensions: research depth, systems realism, and open communication.

We study core AI questions at the intersection of intelligence, optimization, and distributed systems; we test ideas under real-world constraints; and we share progress through concise blogs and news updates.

This site shares our direction, people, and milestones as the lab grows.
